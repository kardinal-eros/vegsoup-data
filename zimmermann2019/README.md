Notes an computerizing the data set
===================================

Cover values
------------

+ Orginal source used cover codes `2` and `2m`, `2a`, `2b` in an inconsitent way. `2` was replaced systematically with `2a`
+ missing cover code `V` was replaced with `+` (Entodon concinnus)

Species groups (aggregates)
---------------------------

+ *Aquilegia vulgaris* agg. as *Aquilegia atrata* (certainly this taxon)
+ *Anthoxanthum odoratum* agg. as *Anthoxanthum odoratum* s.str. (certainly this taxon)
+ *Viola sylvestris* agg.	as *Viola reichenbachiana* (most likely this taxon)
+ *Galium pusillum+ agg. as *Galium anisophyllon* (most likely this taxon)
+ *Polygala amara* agg. as *Polygala amara* s.lat. (most likely this taxon)
+ *Thymus pulegioides et praecox* was interpreted as *Thymus praecox* s.lat (questionable)
